## Vapnik-Chervonenkis Game

**File:** [vapnik-chervonenkis-game.html](vapnik-chervonenkis-game.html)

What does it mean to **shatter** a dataset? This game teaches the concept behind Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension through interactive point classification. Learn how different separators (lines, circles, rectangles) can classify datasets and discover when a hypothesis class can shatter any configuration of points.

**Key Concepts:** VC-dimension, shattering, hypothesis classes, classification

## Rademacher Complexity Calculator

**File:** [rademacher-calculator.html](rademacher-calculator.html)

What is Rademacher complexity? Play around with different degree polynomials and random data to explore this fundamental concept in statistical learning theory. This interactive calculator performs numerical Rademacher complexity calculations with real-time visualizations.

**Key Concepts:** Rademacher complexity, generalization bounds, polynomial fitting

## Overfitting Explorer

**File:** [overfitting-explorer.html](overfitting-explorer.html)

Explore the fundamental tradeoff between bias and variance through interactive polynomial fitting. Adjust model complexity, data size, and noise levels to see overfitting happen in real-time. Includes bias-variance decomposition analysis and learning curves to understand when models generalize well vs. when they memorize training data.

**Key Concepts:** Overfitting, underfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, model complexity, generalization
