# Learning Theory Games

Interactive games for teaching learning theory concepts

These are standalone programs. Just download one of these HTML files to your
computer and open it in a web browser.

## Vapnik-Chervonenkis Game

**File:** [vapnik-chervonenkis-game.html](vapnik-chervonenkis-game.html)

What does it mean to **shatter** a dataset? This game teaches the concept behind Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension through interactive point classification. Learn how different separators (lines, circles, rectangles) can classify datasets and discover when a hypothesis class can shatter any configuration of points.

**Key Concepts:** VC-dimension, shattering, hypothesis classes, classification

## Rademacher Complexity Calculator

**File:** [rademacher-calculator.html](rademacher-calculator.html)

What is Rademacher complexity? Play around with different degree polynomials and random data to explore this fundamental concept in statistical learning theory. This interactive calculator performs numerical Rademacher complexity calculations with real-time visualizations.

**Key Concepts:** Rademacher complexity, generalization bounds, polynomial fitting

## Overfitting Explorer

**File:** [overfitting-explorer.html](overfitting-explorer.html)

Explore the fundamental tradeoff between bias and variance through interactive polynomial fitting. Adjust model complexity, data size, and noise levels to see overfitting happen in real-time. Includes bias-variance decomposition analysis and learning curves to understand when models generalize well vs. when they memorize training data.

**Key Concepts:** Overfitting, underfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, model complexity, generalization

## P-adic Gibbs Regression Explorer

**File:** [padic-gibbs-explorer.html](padic-gibbs-explorer.html)

Discover how regression works in non-Archimedean settings through interactive p-adic linear regression. Unlike traditional regression that minimizes Euclidean distance, p-adic regression uses the p-adic norm where "closeness" has a completely different meaning. Watch as the Gibbs sampler explores parameter space using Boltzmann acceptance probabilities, with real-time convergence analysis and trend visualization. This is the implementation from https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23488 *p-Adic Polynomial Regression as Alternative to Neural Network for Approximating p-Adic Functions of Many Variables* by Alexander Zubrev.

**Key Concepts:** p-adic numbers, non-Archimedean analysis, Gibbs sampling, Boltzmann distribution, alternative geometries
