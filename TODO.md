# TODO: Learning Theory Games

## Infrastructure
- ~~Fix autodeployment from GitHub~~

## Core Learning Theory Concepts
- Overfitting Explorer: Interactive polynomial fitting with adjustable degree and noise, real-time bias-variance decomposition
- Cross-Validation Simulator: Visual k-fold CV with draggable data splits, compare validation strategies
- Regularization Playground: Side-by-side L1 vs L2 regularization effects with interactive lambda slider
- Create an interactive Perceptron mistake bound game
- Build a decision tree pruning simulator to explore bias-variance tradeoff
- Develop a game illustrating PAC learning through sample complexity experiments
- Add a boosting intuition game showing how weak learners combine into strong ones

## Advanced Concepts
- Learning Curves Interactive Lab: Performance vs training set size for different algorithms
- Concentration Inequalities Demonstrator: Interactive Hoeffding's inequality with coin flips
- Generalization Bounds Comparison: Compare VC bounds vs Rademacher bounds vs PAC-Bayes

## Practical ML Concepts
- Active Learning Game: Budget-constrained labeling with different sampling strategies
- Multi-Armed Bandits Casino: Slot machines comparing Îµ-greedy, UCB, Thompson sampling
- Ensemble Methods Battle: Side-by-side bagging vs boosting comparison

## Theoretical Foundations
- No Free Lunch Theorem Demo: Multiple datasets where different algorithms excel
- Online Learning Regret Minimization: Sequential decision making with regret visualization

## Research-Aligned Games (P-adic ML & Ultrametrics)
- Ultrametric Distance Explorer: Interactive visualization of ultrametric vs Euclidean distance properties
- P-adic Number Playground: Interactive exploration of p-adic norms and distances
- Narrative Hypothesis Testing Game: Language models generating and testing hypotheses about datasets
- Non-Archimedean Learning Theory: How classical learning bounds change in ultrametric settings

## Legacy/Academic (Low Priority)
- ~~Implement a game demonstrating margin maximization in Support Vector Machines~~ (SVMs rarely used in practice)
- ~~Kernel Trick Visualizer~~ (SVM-focused, low practical value)
